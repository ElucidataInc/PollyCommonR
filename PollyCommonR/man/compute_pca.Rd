\usage{
compute_pca(sample_raw_mat = NULL, num = NULL, center = FALSE, scale = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample_raw_mat}{matrix/dataframe containing raw values.}

\item{num}{Number of genes/metabolites to be used for pca.}

\item{center}{a logical value indicating whether the variables should be 
shifted to be zero centered. Alternately, a vector of length equal the 
number of columns of x can be supplied. The value is passed to scale.}

\item{scale}{a logical value indicating whether the variables should be 
scaled to have unit variance before the analysis takes place. The default
 is FALSE for consistency with S, but in general scaling is advisable. 
 Alternatively, a vector of length equal the number of columns of x can 
 be supplied. The value is passed to scale (base function).}
